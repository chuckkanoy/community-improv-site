            <h1>A Little More About Imp Mob Improv</h1>
            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
                Imp Mob Improv is an improv troupes whose members are primarily comprised of former
                and current members of NDSU's improv troupe To Be Determined Comedy.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
            <p>
                We aim to further our understanding of improvisation, entertaining members of
                the Fargo Moorhead community along the way.
            </p>
            <h3>What to Expect at a Show</h3>
            <p>
                While we are a group that specializes in improv comedy, we have been known to dabble 
                in more plot-oriented scenes. When performers ask for a suggestion, we'll look to
                you to throw out something. Together as performers and an audience, we will create
                an experience truly unique to each show and location. We hope to see you at one
                soon.ðŸ˜ˆ
